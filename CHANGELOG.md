# Changelog

Entries in the commit-message format (`version - short description in English`),
newest first. **Each `##` heading is literally the commit subject** — the entry
is written *before* the commit, so the sentence that lands in `git log` is one
that was weighed rather than improvised at `git commit` time.

Bodies are narrative: what changed, why, and what was measured. This file is
never rewritten.

> **The record starts here.** This file was created after the repository was:
> earlier versions are in `git log` and are deliberately not back-filled, because
> reconstructing them now would produce a plausible history rather than a true
> one.


## 0.9.1 - the echo blocks are regenerated from repodocs

The marked rules in `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` are rewritten from the single
source at [samirhvbr/repodocs](https://github.com/samirhvbr/repodocs):
`QUEUE-RULE`, `RELEASES-RULE`, `LANGUAGE-RULE`, `COMMIT-RULE` and `CICD-RULE`.
A block is replaced whole between its markers, heading included — which is what
stops a local edit from surviving a regeneration and confusing the next reader.

`QUEUE-RULE` is new and arrives here for the first time: `.continue/` holds work
that does not exist yet, and a document leaves it when — and only when — the
thing it describes **exists**. Length, language and untidiness are not exit
conditions. **Never empty that folder as tidying.**
