# SHVIA-BENCH — Isolated environment for benchmarking coding models

> ⚠️ **Before working on this repository: `git pull`.**

🇧🇷 [Versão em português](README_br.md)

**A reproducible, contamination-controlled harness for benchmarking LLMs on
software-engineering tasks.** Spec: [`docs/ambiente-isolado.md`](docs/ambiente-isolado.md) (v0.2);
operator runbook: [`docs/rodar.md`](docs/rodar.md).

SHVIA-BENCH is **not** a scoring rubric and **not** a task suite. It is the layer
underneath both: the sterile environment and the instrumentation that let you
compare models fairly. It answers *"how do we run the model with zero unfair
information, and measure everything that happened?"* — while a separate project,
the **[LEB / AI-BENCHMARK](https://github.com/samirhvbr/AI-BENCHMARK)**, answers
*"what is the task, and how is the answer scored?"*. SHVIA-BENCH runs LEB
instances (its first task source) inside a controlled sandbox.

## The one principle

> No run may have access to information another run lacks. If an artifact cannot
> be recreated from scratch from the benchmark repository, it does not enter the
> run.

That cuts persistent memory, conversation history, agent context files, local
cache, RAG/indexing and telemetry. See the 18 contamination vectors (V1–V18) in
the spec.

## Two tracks

- **Track A — raw model:** one request, no tools, no filesystem. Measures raw
  single-response capability.
- **Track B — model + harness:** the same task inside a coding agent (e.g. Claude
  Code), in an ephemeral workspace, non-interactive, to completion or limit.
  Measures the *model + harness* pair.

Comparing A vs B of the same model quantifies **harness gain**.

## Why isolation is `HOME` + process env, not the working directory

A CLI started inside `~/bench/task-01/` still reads user settings, MCP config,
inherited env, prior transcripts and a `CLAUDE.md` hierarchy from *outside* that
folder. New folder, old contamination. The real boundary is **`HOME` + process
environment** — so the runner uses `env -i` + a sandbox `HOME` +
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR`, on the same machine, no container, without touching your
real Claude Code install. (See spec §4.0.)

## Layout

```
runner/run.sh        env -i + sandbox HOME + CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR — sanitized entrypoint (§4.2)
runner/audit.sh      blocking pre-run audit, block A (A1–A14) → audit.json (§11)
runner/canary.sh     A5 tool canary: proves a planted MCP does NOT leak in (live + --selftest)
runner/status.py     SINGLE arbiter of `status` — two orthogonal axes (§10.4)
runner/campaign_leb.sh   one LEB case end-to-end; never overwrites paid results
proxy/logging_proxy.py   passive logging proxy → proxy.jsonl: TTFT, usage, dest allowlist (§4.4)
config/profile.template/ versioned sandbox HOME (minimal, explicit settings)
config/mcp.empty.json    {"mcpServers": {}}
tasks/T-000-noop/        trivial task — measures the harness's fixed context overhead (§10.6)
manifest.schema.json     run manifest (§8.1); a run aborts if audit_passed is false
docs/rodar.md            operator runbook (how to actually run a campaign)
tests/run_all.sh         the whole offline suite in one command
runs/                    WRITE-ONLY for execution. No process that runs a model reads
                         from here — that is what keeps a previous result from feeding
                         a future run (§4.1). Post-run steps (verify patching,
                         reclassify, summaries) do read it: they run after the fact
                         and feed no model.
work/                    ephemeral per-task workspaces
```

**`status` is not a single axis.** `harness_outcome` (did the execution yield a
valid measurement?) and `verification` (did the delivery pass the task's verifier?)
are separate. Only the verifier may emit `failed_verification` — an API/infra error
is `infra_error` and never becomes the model's score. This is enforced structurally
in `runner/status.py`, after a transient API error was once recorded as a benchmark
failure on a paid run that had actually passed.

## Status — Phase 1 (foundation)

- [x] Sanitized `run.sh`, sandbox profile, blocking audit block A
- [x] Passive logging proxy (validated offline against a local dummy upstream)
- [x] `T-000-noop`, manifest schema, preflight
- [x] Canary A5 **detector** proven with fixtures (offline)
- [ ] **Live exit criterion** — planting a real MCP and running `claude` to prove
      A5, plus measuring `context_overhead_tokens` — needs the bench API key
      (`.secrets/anthropic`). This is the project's standing "smoke ao vivo" gate.
- [x] **Track A runner** (`track_a.py`) — **multi-vendor**: `config/gateways.json`
      covers Anthropic (native) + OpenAI-compatible vendors (OpenAI, xAI/Grok,
      DeepSeek, Z.ai/GLM, Novita, OpenRouter, Kilo). Streaming, per-vendor request
      shaping + auth, cost recompute, N-reps + variance. Offline 18/18. Real
      campaign gated on each vendor's key (`.secrets/<vendor>`).
- [x] **Track B runner** (`track_b.py` + `collect.py`) — drives isolated
      `claude -p`, fuses C1 (result) + C2 (transcript) + C3 (proxy); Claude Code
      2.1.207 surface validated empirically (`config/harness-matrix.md`); offline
      test 30/30. Real campaign gated on the bench key.
- [x] **LEB wired as Track B task source** (`leb.py`, `campaign_leb.sh`) — real
      legacy-evolution cases, verified by the LEB's own docker harness post-run.
- [x] **Measurement integrity (0.7.0)** — two-axis `status` (`runner/status.py`),
      transcript found by session id, paid results never overwritten, campaign
      resumable via `--from-rep`. Offline suite: `bash tests/run_all.sh`
      (67 checks in the taxonomy suite alone).
- [ ] Phase 4 — real campaign (live A5/A14, LEB instances, §14 operator decisions)

## Requirements

`bash`, `python3` (stdlib only — no external deps), `git`, `openssl`; `docker`
only for LEB instances (not for Phase 1). Run `./preflight.sh` to check.

## Secrets

The bench API key lives in `.secrets/anthropic` (gitignored), injected
individually by `run.sh`. Never `source`d, never versioned, never passed as a CLI
argument.
